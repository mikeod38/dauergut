**Figure 8**  
Model for weighting of environmental cues in the regulation of dauer development and behavior. In larvae, pheromone primarily downregulates expression of _daf-7_ and _daf-28_ in ASI, whereas heat downregulates _daf-28_ expression in both ASI and ASJ to promote dauer formation. TORC2 signaling acts in the gut in a diet-dependent manner to target both _daf-7_ and _daf-28_ expression, thereby allowing hierarchical integration of internal metabolic state signals with external cues. TORC2 signaling in the gut also acts via PDFR-1 to modulate adult exploratory behaviors.
